UEGPY
=====

UEGPY is a collection of python modules which can be combined to calculate various
properties of the uniform electron gas (UEG).

Currently we can calculate:

* Internal, potential and free energies for the the 3D-UEG as a function of
  temperature at various levels of approximation (ideal, Hartree--Fock and RPA.)

* Dynamic properties such as density-density reposonse at any temperature.

* Static and dynamic structure factors.

Most of these quantities can be calculated in the thermodynamic limit as well as
for a finite number of electrons in the canonical and grand canonical ensemble.

Documentation is mostly in the form of docstrings listed below.
